    "1": "How this works: These 'master keys' are used to decrypt your raw API keys and secrets listed in the (keys-private-raw.json) file.",
    "2": "Security: These passwords are (super) sensitive. Don't commit them to your repository. Add '*password*' to your .gitignore.",
    "3": "Env Variable: Optionally you may want to override this file with an environmental variable. To do that use the 'master-password' filter in your start.js file (setup callback).",
    "4": "Benefit 1: This approach prevents you from managing tons of different API keys via your backend. That leads to potential 'leaks' and complication.",
    "5": "Benefit 2: You can give the 'dev' password to developers who you may not want to give 'god mode' access to backend services."
